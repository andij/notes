# Naming

## Article vs Section

The `<section>` element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.

The `<article>` element represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable.
