### WHY, but Why?

* Peeps understand how to use
* Not repeating ourselves
* When we're no longer there
* New joiners on-boarding
* Self serving
* Defining decisions we make
* This is the Design System

### Who's going to use is?

* Devs
* Designers
* Product Owners
* Brand
* QA
* CMS
* Content
* New joiners

### How / When will they use it?

* Given a link by us
* They already started working on something
* Source of truth
* New joiners - spend time reading
* Decision backup

### How do we measure success

* Less questions we receive from community members
* We are documenting all the time, it's part of the process
* More Nucleus on BG Website

### Feedback

* Currently our documentation is lengthy

## Team task

* Find 2 examples within our documentation that are good
* Find 2 examples within our documentation that are bad

{% hint style="warning" %}
Phased out, not Faced out  
Text heavy  
Brand alignment  
Panel Component is misleading - nothing about the layout - names are inconsistent  
Dialling our creative principles - things that don't exist any more  
Frontify - is a poor experience  
Inconsistent naming - typography  
More than one source of truth - colours  
Lockup Component - nonexistent  
Where does Nucleus being and end? Brand guidelines - Designer playbook - check atlassian.design  
Blanding page  
Levels of information are inconsistent - high level, practical, rational, details  
The Design System does not reflect us as a team
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Explaining ourselves  
The "quotes are nice to skim read  
Creating Illustrations - prescriptive - tools - no waffle - explain - thoughtful  
Accordion Component - easy to understand - real examples within documentation  
The content around the principles  
The Landmark section especially the Specification table  
Do's and Don't - real good to consume  
Becoming Nucleus  
The use of active verbs on our Homepage CTAs  
Events section - projecting a timeline of our history - about our community
{% endhint %}
