Getting to grips with the complexity of interactions and accessibility

## ns-calendar

## Table

As `ns-calendar` is built with an html table, the following markup is expected:

```html
<table>
  <caption>Month YYYY</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Day</th>
      ...
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>1</td>
      ...
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

## Date

A date is displayed in a cell within the body of the table.

### Passive

There are two types of passive states for a date, either `disabled` or `enabled`.

We had a discussion that there could be a third state of `unavailable` which would be selectable, but this has been scrapped. 

Both `disabled` and `enabled` days could be `today`.

NOTE: A cell within the table can be `empty`. This is to retain the integrity of the html table but play no part in its functionality.

* `disabled`
  * `today`
* `enabled`
  * `today`
* `empty` - in all cases, this should be **no change**. Essentially act as if it's not there.

### Mouse

#### Hover

When the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).

##### Cursor

All three types of passive dates can be hovered over with the mouse cursor. The expected response of the cursor is:

* `disabled` - no change in cursor:  `cursor: default;` 
  * `today` - same as above
* `enabled` - display cursor as if it were a hyperlink: `cursor: pointer;`
  * `today` - same as above

##### Content

Interacting with the passive dates with the mouse:

* `disabled` - no change
  * `today` - no change
* `enabled` - display the content as a hyperlink: `text-decoration: underline;`
  * `today` - **NOTE:** The hover state of `enabled today` should be distinguishable from the passive representation of `today`.

##### Container

The container of the date has no interaction on mouse hover

#### Click

When the user has placed a pointing device over an element and presses the pointing device primary button (the left mouse button or a single finger touchpad tap).

**NOTE:** The hover state is present at this point in time as defined in the Hover section above.

##### Cursor

* `disabled` - no change
  * `today` - no change
* `enabled` - no change
  * `today` - no change

##### Content

* `disabled` - no change
  * `today` - no change
* `enabled` - Introduce a significant change in visual appearance. **NOTE:** that it's currently in a hovered state.
  * `today` - a significant visual difference or addition between a passive representation of `enabled today` to represent `enabled today click` this state is showing "selected today". 

##### Container

* `disabled` - no change
  * `today` - no change
* `enabled` - no change
  * `today` - no change
