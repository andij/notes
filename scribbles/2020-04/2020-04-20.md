> This stuff is really hard and it’s really complex and there’s a lot of players and there’s always politics.
>
> It can be easier to get your heads down, do this thing, present it and then say: “Well now other people should adopt this".
>
> Sometimes it’s easier if you’re on a short timeline and you don’t really want to care about other things.
>
> But in the longterm, it’s always easier to bring other people in and create accountability for yourself by getting feedback at every level. Even though it’s going to change things, things are going to get moved around. It’s just better.
