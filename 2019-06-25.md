Hi there, I'm Drew Jones from the Nucleus Design System Team.

Today, I'd like to share with you one of our design system foundations, Modular Scale.

We have a number of foundations within the Design System. Accessibility, Colour and Typography are a few others.

We found ourselves searching for a way to capture the designers eye from within our code.

This lead us to research; engineering, architecture and nature.

Within nature we found many beautiful patterns that are calculable.

The fibonacci sequence, maybe better known as the golden ratio is one where: The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

Scales are abundant within nature, the golden ratio can be found in the microscopic world of DNA to the size of our own milky way galaxy.

Harmonics and frequencies play their part, each individual colour has it's own frequency of light. Each note on a piano has been carefully chosen.

Take a look at this diagram on the right, imagine this is a string of a guitar. At the very top it's showing the open string, on the second line it's showing the string pressed to the fretboard precisely in the middle, an octave higher and so on. each node shown on the diagram is a different harmonic.

Each note on this scale is a familiar and beautiful sound.

We have taken lessons learned from nature, and applied them to our design system in order to be able to calculate and produce beauty and simplicity from our code.

So, where do **we** start? 

> Slide

Let's start by looking at the different scales from the world of music. 

> Slide

Here are these scales as their numerical representation as ratios. Some of these maybe familiar. Such as 3:4, a popular ratio of a photograph, there's 16:9, a widescreen TV.

> Slide

We turn these ratios into their decimal fractions, which will allow us to include them in our code. There are many to choose from, so let's pick just a few.
