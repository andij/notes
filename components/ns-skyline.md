# ns-skyline

## Introduction

> Notifying visitors of current, ongoing or upcoming events that they may be relevant to them.

Positioned directly beneath the global navigation and above any content, `ns-skyline` displays high level messages to the user.  The purpose of `ns-skyline` is to notify the user of important site-wide or non-page specific events that may affect their experience of using the British Gas website.

They are either:

* Informational - to show useful information that the user may want to be aware of, e.g. upcoming price changes.
* Warning - to warn users of potential upcoming or current issues e.g. weather warning.

## Best practice

| üíö Do's | üíî Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Position `ns-skyline` directly underneath the main navigation. | Include a link in the heading. |
| Communicate the message in a clear and concise way as possible. Ideally, it should be able to be explained in the heading in one sentence. | Use for error messaging. |
| Use inline links to support content and aid the user find helpful information. | Use it for page specific messages. |
| Add the icon that matches the context of the message; `warning` or `info`. | Use if for non-important messages. |
|  | Make the message longer than necessary. |

### Considerations of best practice

* Do not include a link in the heading. It's used to open and close the content of `ns-expander` and won't be clickable.
* Use sparingly for only the most important information.
* Not be used as the primary entry point to information or actions users need on a regular basis.
* Do not use for marketing information or up-sell.
