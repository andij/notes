# ns-tabs

## Introduction

> Tabs provide organisation of content separated within the same context.

Related content can be separated into clearly labelled sections.

## Content guidance

| Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tabs |  |
| Panels |  |

## Best practice

| üíö Do's | üíî Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use at least two tabs | Use an excessive amount of tabs |
| Be mindful of the extra page weight | Use more than two words for your tab label |

### Considerations of best practice

* It is advisable to use tabs alongside other components to avoid building a page that consists only of tabs.
* If you see that the tabs are bleeding over the edge of the page in Polo or Rugby, and you have followed the guidance on not using more than two words on the tab label, then you probably have too many tabs.
* Consider breaking out some of your content and make sure the content is all relevant to that page.
* Related tab and panel slots should be put together in order when adding the content.

## Component Relationship

|  **Relationship**  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Does it live in a panel?** | ‚ùå No |
| **Does it live inside other components?** | ‚ùå No |
| **What layout classes can be used?**  | None |

A close relationship exists between `ns-tab` and `ns-panel`. Within `ns-tabs` a number of `ns-tab` and `ns-panel` pairs exist. Each of these pairs provide a tab to select and a panel to place a layout and related content.

## Specification

| Attribute | Type | Default   | Options   | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `open` | `number`    | `0` |  | Number relates to the order of the tabs |

| Slots | Type |

## Specification notes

* Multiple tab slots should be added to add multiple tabs. There should be the same amount of tab slots as panel slots.

### Panel

* Multiple panel slots should be added to add multiple panels. There should be the same amount of panel slots as tab slots.
