# ns-cta

## Introduction

> A call-to-action allows users to take action once they are ready for it.

We allow users to perform certain actions through the use of our call to actions (CTAs). It should always be clear to the user what the CTA's action is through text.

## Content guidance

| Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- |
| Text    	   |  |
| Icon		     |  |

## Best practice

| üíö Do's | üíî Dont's |
| :--- | :--- |
| Make it short and actionable | Make it vague |
| Only use 'loading' on an action | Make it overly wordy |
| Relate the action to the content it sits beside | Use icons for icons' sake |
| Use 'direct' for the primary action on the page | Use more than 24 characters |
|  | Have multiple lines or sentences within a CTA |
|  | Repeat CTA copy within the same page |

### Considerations of best practice

* To be aware of the distinct roles of the CTA's types `direct` and `text` and that they don't always act as a `primary` and `secondary` button.
* Try not to have multiple CTA's next to each other.
* Don't overload the page with the same type of CTA or too many CTA's.
* Loading message should be the action of the text of the CTA. E.g. "Get a quote" becomes "Getting your quote...".

## Usage

To see examples visit [Storybook](https://britishgas.co.uk/nucleus/demo/index.html?path=/story/ns-cta--direct-link).

`ns-cta` should always live inside another component.

## Specification notes

### Icons

* Icons are not descriptive, they are supplementary to the text.

### Href

* Can be used instead of having a wrapper anchor
* This shouldn't be used if `onClick` event is added.
