## Introduction

> Caveats provide additional information and legal details to content.

Caveats link to content in the page, providing more information about legality and eligibility, by seperating it to the bottom of the page.

## Best practice

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Try to make the caveats positive | Use the caveat to hide information |
| Be transparent, if the legal details are short, add it to the content | Add images, iconography, etc. |
| Always have the legal caveats at the bottom of the page, before the footer | Try to change the font size of the caveats |
| Use an ordered list for the caveats |  |
| Only use text in the caveats |  |
| Embolden text that is important |  |

### Considerations of best practice

* We highly recommend that there are no more than three caveats in a single piece of communication.
* Link to additional information, if needed such as terms, but should always be accompanied with a related description.
