# ns-card

## Introduction

> Cards can be used to contain content in a consistent and structured way.

Cards are used to apply a container around a related grouping of information; this can be done through imagery, illustrations and typography.

## Content guidance

| Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- |
| Heading      |  |
| Paragraph    |  |
| CTA          |  |

### Image guidance

| Component | Variant | Ratio | Dimensions | Size | Type | Placeholder |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ns-card`| `support` | 16:9 | 640x360px | &lt; 50kb | jpeg | [ns-card-support-640x360px](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50207859/67642149-d3c91e00-f900-11e9-983c-9b812217b801.jpg) |

## Best practice

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Always use them in the triple layout | Use the text CTA in the section card |
| Use to direct customers to the actions | Mix card types in a row |
| Embolden text in the paragrah that is important | Have two or more cta's for a card |
| Make your CTA copy unique, stating the action | Repeat the CTA copy in each card |
| Use section cards to navigate users to primary actions | Use inline links in the paragraph |
| Consider using decoration in the panel to add emphasis on the cards |  |
|  | Use the section card without a decoration |

### Considerations of best practice

* Consider your CTA type and try to keep them consistent between rows across the cards, unless there is a need.
* There can be less than three cards in a row, but it should always use the triple layout. Always consider a lockup for this, before using the cards.
* Headings work best with one to four words.
* Please check the imagery guidlines when adding an image to the card.
* Be careful when using decoration in the panel with the section cards as the blue on blue with the CTA's will make them not accessible.
* There should always be a heading to the group of cards inside the panel.
