## FAQ [Template]

### Can I become who I want to be?

That's a tough question but thankfully, our team is on it. Please bear with us while we're investigating.

### Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.

## Guide [Template]

### Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```text
$ give me super-powers
```

Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```text
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```

```javascript
{
    "name": "Cake's name",

    "cake": "Binary cake"
}
```

```javascript
{
    "message": "Ain't no cake like that."
}
```
